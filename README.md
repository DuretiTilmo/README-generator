# README Generator

## Description

A starter code was provided for this challenge to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professinoal README.md file from a user's input using an environment, like package.json. Answers to prompts are used to determine the templates and contents of the file. A default value for when a user doesn't input anything, object destructuring, template literals and many more node.js extended functionalities are implemented to build this application.
